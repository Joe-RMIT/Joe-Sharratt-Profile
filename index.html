					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest start?</h3><br>
					<p>While I have always been interested in IT in a general sense, I am especially interested in artificial intelligence and machine learning. More specifically, the ability for AI and machine learning to support data science and analytics. While this originally stemmed from my love of sports analytics, this interest has expanded to include the role that AI and machine learning can play in security and intelligence analysis.</p>
					<h3>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</h3><br>
					<p>My earliest interaction with the IT industry came through my passion for playing video games as a child. This passion for video games has largely been a constant throughout my life, and the rise of online multiplayer games has served as a starting point for my desire to develop my knowledge and understanding of programming and networking.<br>
					All of my current IT experience has been gained in my various roles working in the audio industry that have allowed me to gain a basic understanding of computer networks. However, I am almost entirely self-taught and am looking to further my understanding through tertiary education.</p>
					<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3><br>
					<p>I am currently undertaking a Bachelor of Security Studies via Open Universities and decided to take the Introduction to IT and Introduction to Programming classes offered by RMIT as electives in an effort to expand my skillset and hopefully take on subjects in data science later in my degree.</p>
					<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3><br>
					<p>I expect to gain a basic understanding of many of the major elements of the IT industry and its role in modern society. Further, I expect to be able to build on the foundations provided by RMIT’s Introduction to IT class by taking additional classes in programming and data science.</p>

					<h2>Team Leader (Intelligence Operations)</h2><br>
					<p>Australian Federal Police</p>
					<a id="link" href="joblisting.pdf" target="_blank"> Job Listing Link</a><br>
					<br><h3>Organisation</h3><br>
					<p>Australian Federal Police</p>
					<h3>Role Description</h3>
					<p><br>This role involves leading and managing a small intelligence team focused around delivering operational technical analysis in line with the Australian Federal Police’s broader intelligence strategy.<br>
						<br>More specifically, this Team Leader role revolves around the management of intelligence resources to ensure that criminal intelligence analysis is delivered to key stakeholders at the local, national, and international level in an efficient and timely manner. Further, the role requires the applicant to provide mentorship and career development opportunities to more junior staff as well as implementing change and improvement strategies to increase team efficiency.<br>
						<br>This role, like most modern intelligence roles, requires a strong understanding of IT systems, as analysts are required to utilise advanced analytical applications such as IBM’s ‘Analyst’s Notebook’. Further, a working knowledge of coding languages such as Python are crucial, as intelligence roles often require working with – or developing – bespoke, open-source tools designed to scrape data from websites and social media networks.</p>
					<h3>Skills Required</h3><br>
					<p>Seeing as this role is for a senior position, the job listing prioritises a solid understanding of intelligence concepts and methods, as well as the proven ability to lead a small team of intelligence practitioners. Further, the role requires extremely high communication skills, and a strong understanding of the IT systems used by the Australian Federal Police.</p>
					<h3>Current Skills</h3><br>
					<p>I completed a Bachelor of Audio Engineering & Sound Production in 2011 and have experience in both music production and forensic audio. My forensic audio experience in particular has provided me with experience in database management and secure data storage, as I am expected to maintain multiple copies of sensitive material for long periods of time.<br>
						<br>Further, through my recent roles in managing and operating recording studios, I have also gained experience in setting up and troubleshooting simple computer networks.</p>
					<h3>Learning Plan</h3><br>
					<p>I am currently undertaking a Bachelor of Security Studies at Macquarie University, which will provide me with a solid understanding of intelligence and its role in policing. To further enhance my knowledge of policing and the Australian criminal justice system I have also taken electives in criminology and law, and regularly participate in intelligence industry events hosted by the Australian Institute of Professional Intelligence Officers.<br>
						<br>I am also looking to expand my understanding of IT and develop my programming skills by taking the Introduction to IT and Introduction to Programming classes provided by RMIT. These classes will hopefully provide me with a deeper understanding of computer networks, as well as allowing me to develop my programming skills.<br>
						<br>Next year I plan to expand on these skills, taking additional RMIT classes in programming and database management in the hopes of gaining the skills required to work with the kinds of big data systems utilised by State and Federal law enforcement.</p>

					<h2>What Do The Results of These Tests Mean for You?</h2><br>
					<p>I believe that while the results of these tests should be taken with a grain of salt, they provide a surprisingly accurate overview of some of my core personality traits. In particular, I found the results of the Myer-Briggs test to be especially insightful. The results of this test suggest that I am an intuitive introvert that enjoys executing carefully thought-out plans (Neris Analytics Limited 2021). Importantly, the Myer-Briggs test also highlights my strengths in conflict resolution, stating that INFJ-A individuals have the ability to quickly identify and defuse conflicts in group settings well before they reach a boiling point (Neris Analytics Limited 2021).<br>
					<br>In many ways, the Big Five personality test supports these results. For example the Big Five personality test gave me a score of 83% for ‘openness’, which “describes a person’s tendency to think in abstract, complex ways” (Truity 2021). This appears to correlate well with the traits described in my INFJ-A Myer-Briggs result. Finally, I took a learning style test which resulted in me being labelled as a ‘tactile’ learner. This means that I tend to learn more efficiently by touching and doing, rather than listening or watching. Further, tactile learners are likely to “easily remember things that were done but may have difficulty remembering what you saw or heard in the process” (Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency 2021).<br>
					<br>While I don’t believe any single personality test can be completely accurate, I find the consistency of results between the Myer-Briggs test and the Big Five personality test to be extremely interesting, and I would definitely agree with the majority of what the results show in these two tests. Finally, I found the results of the learning style test to be the most surprising, as I had assumed that I would have been more of an auditory listener considering my career as an audio engineer. Nevertheless, the feedback from this test suggests that I learn better when I am able to take frequent, short breaks during periods of focused study, which lends itself nicely to my productivity-focused IT project idea which will be discussed later in this report.</p>

				<article>
					<h2>How do You Think These Results may Influence Your Behaviour in a Team?</h2><br>
					<p>On one hand, the results of both the Myer-Briggs test and the Big Five personality test highlight my introverted nature and this is something I will need to keep in mind when conducting group work to ensure that I do not become too passive during discussions or meetings. On the other hand, both of these tests also highlight my strengths in abstract, complex thought and analysis which I believe will serve me well when problem solving issues as they arise in the project.<br>
						<br>Another positive that I draw from the test results is my strength in planning out complex tasks which may add a sense of structure to the group project. However, I will need to be mindful that it is equally important to remain adaptable in order to efficiently take on unexpected challenges as they arise.<br>
						<br>Finally, my ‘tactile’ learning style means that I will thrive in situations that require an element of trial-and-error, however I may need to ensure that I am taking regular, detailed notes during group meetings to maximise my ability to retain information.<br>
					</p>
				</article><br>

				<article>
					<h2>How Should You Take This Into Account When Forming a Team?</h2><br>
					<p>I have always found that teams are at their best when there is a diverse set of personalities working cooperatively. With that in mind, I would look to team up with more extraverted people from a diverse range of technical or intellectual backgrounds. I would also like to work with highly adaptable people who thrive in less structured settings as I feel that they would provide some much-needed flexibility to my desire to plan out tasks.<br>
						<br>However, while I believe diverse groups are capable of having a hugely positive influence over a project’s outcome, there is always the potential for conflicts to arise. As a result, I will look to lean on the conflict resolution strengths highlighted in my Myer-Briggs test results by trying to seek out and resolve points of potential conflict before they become major issues.</p>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
				<p class="subDetails">Pomodoro Day Planner</p>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2><br>
					<p>The Pomodoro Day Planner is a productivity application that will be developed for Apple’s iOS. The application revolves around the ‘pomodoro’ productivity system. This system involves a set of timers which break tasks into short periods of focused and intensive work followed by a short break. Where the Pomodoro Day Planner will differ from similar iOS applications is its attempt to create an all-encompassing task-management system alongside the traditional Pomodoro timer. Features will include an integrated to-do list and a daily reflection journal.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2><br>
					<p>I have been experimenting with a variety of different productivity applications over the past few years and have yet to find the perfect tool for my workflow. As a result, I view the Pomodoro Day Planner as a solution to a personal problem.<br>
						<br>As it stands, I use three different productivity tools every day. I use ‘Notion’ for my task management & to-do list, ‘Day One’ for my journaling and daily reflection, and ‘Emphasis’ as my Pomodoro timer. While these applications are good at handling their individual tasks, I would like to be able to create one application that I could work in for the majority of my workday.
						</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2><br>
					<p>Pomodoro Day Planner is an iOS application that revolves around three core features. First and foremost, the application is centred around Francesco Cirillo’s ‘Pomodoro’ productivity system, which is a “simple yet effective tool for focused work with planned breaks in between” (Mandal, 2020). The system encourages the user to remain focused and ‘on-track’ when completing complex tasks by splitting a workday into multiple 25-minute sessions of focused work which are followed by 5-minute breaks. After every fourth completed 25-minute work session, the user takes a longer 15-minute break. These times will serve as the default settings for the timer in Pomodoro Day Planner, however the user will be able to modify the length of work and break sessions in order to tailor the application to their needs.<br>
					<br>Second, the application will feature a simple to-do list. Considering that the application is centred around the idea of focused work, the feature-set of this to-do list will be kept deliberately stripped back compared with other to-do lists such as Apple’s ‘Reminders’ app. The to-do list in Pomodoro Day Planner will allow users to create a to-do list made up of tasks and sub-tasks that will be displayed with a strike-through when marked as completed.<br>
					<br>Third, the application will feature a simple journaling tool that will prompt users each day at a set time with a variety of writing prompts designed to help users reflect on their successes of the day and strive to develop healthy working habits over time. These questions include:</p><br>
					<ul>
						<li>Did you complete your to-do list today?</li>
						<li>What was your biggest win today?</li>
						<li>What long-term project did you work on today?</li>
						<li>What did you have to reschedule?</li>
						<li>What could you have done to be more productive?</li>
						<li>What made your day better?</li>
						<li>What is your most important task for tomorrow?</li>
						<li>What did you listen to today?</li>
					</ul><br>
					<p>Journal entries will be stored locally on a user’s iPhone and will be displayed within a built-in calendar.<br>
						<br>Pomodoro Day Planner is designed to boost productivity and enhance the user’s ability to focus when completing complex tasks. With this in mind, the application will be designed with a minimalist aesthetic and will look to reduce the use of menus and button presses wherever possible. To achieve this, the application will feature three pages that will be accessed via swipe gestures rather than button presses. The main ‘pomodoro’ page will show a simple, circular countdown timer. Underneath this timer, the application will display the number of sessions that have been completed during the workday. The second page will feature the simple to-do list that will allow the user to create, modify and delete tasks. The Third page will display the journal and will allow users to create new entries or recall previous entries from a in-built calendar.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2><br>
					<p>Pomodoro Day Planner will be developed for iOS 15 and will be written in Apple’s ‘Xcode’ application using the ‘Swift’ programming language. As a result, the successful development of the application will require access to an Apple computer capable of running Xcode 13, as well as access to ‘Canva’ which is a free, browser-based graphic design tool. Finally, access to an iPhone with iOS 15 installed will be essential for testing the application prior to launch.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2><br>
					<p>The development of this application primarily relies on a working knowledge of ‘Swift’, which is something I plan to develop throughout this course. However, it is important to note that while programming skills are an obvious necessity, they will need to be supplemented with additional skills to ensure the successful completion of the project. For example, the self-paced nature of software development requires a person with strong time management skills and a natural ability to maintain focus over prolonged periods of time. Further, software development is often inherently a collaborative effort. As a result, strong interpersonal skills are required to ensure that healthy, working relationships with teammates are created and maintained. </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2><br>
					<p>In a broad sense, the application will be considered a success if it successfully solves the initial problems listed in the Product Overview. Namely, the Pomodoro Day Planner will have successfully filled the need for users seeking to boost their productivity through a single application that combines a traditional pomodoro timer, a to-do list, and a daily reflection journal. Further, successful development of the Pomodoro Day Planner will result in the developers registering for the Apple Developer Program and submitting the application for review in an attempt to get the app listed on the iOS App Store.</p>
